## üìä Database Schema Updates

### Recent Additions:

**manuscripts table:**
- `manuscript_summary` (TEXT) - 2-3 sentence story summary
- `full_analysis_key_points` (TEXT) - 5-7 bullet point takeaways
- `full_analysis_text` (TEXT) - Complete analysis text
- `report_pdf_completed_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When PDF report finished
- `report_pdf_url` (TEXT) - URL to stored PDF report

**chapters table:**
- `chapter_summary` (TEXT) - 2-3 sentence chapter summary for context

### Existing Core Tables:
- `author_profiles` - User data linked to Supabase Auth
- `manuscripts` - Manuscript metadata and analysis results
- `chapters` - Individual chapter content and summaries
- `manuscript_issues` - Flagged editing points with status tracking

---

## üîß Key Technical Improvements (Recent)

### 1. **Workflow Separation**
Split monolithic full-analysis workflow into 3 parallel workflows:
- `alex-full-manuscript-analysis` - PDF report generation
- `generate-summary-points` - Editing data (summary + key points)
- `generate-chapter-summaries` - Chapter context

**Benefits:**
- Studio unblocks faster (~2-3 min vs ~5 min)
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- True parallel execution
- Independent failure handling

### 2. **Chapter Analysis Strategy Shift**
**Old:** 2-5 prescriptive issues per dimension (10-25 total per chapter)
**New:** 1-2 conversational "initial thoughts" per chapter

**Rationale:** Authors prefer discussion over overwhelming issue lists

### 3. **Context-Rich Analysis**
Chapter analysis now includes:
- Manuscript summary (the "why" of the story)
- Key points from full analysis (high-level patterns)
- Previous chapter summary (continuity)
- Current chapter content

**Result:** More coherent, story-aware suggestions

### 4. **PostgreSQL Dollar Quoting**
All text storage uses `$delimiter$...$delimiter$` to handle apostrophes and special characters safely.

### 5. **Branding Update**
Changed from "Spike Island AI" to "AuthorsLab.ai" across:
- PDF report templates
- Email templates
- Frontend messaging

## üÜò Recent Solutions & Fixes

### **Workflow Timing Issues:**
- Solution: Split workflows to unblock studio faster
- Moved completion markers to fastest branch (summary generation)
- PDF generation continues in background

### **Chapter Analysis Context:**
- Problem: Alex generating irrelevant suggestions
- Solution: Fetch manuscript summary, key points, and previous chapter before analysis
- Result: Contextually aware, coherent suggestions

### **Text Storage with Apostrophes:**
- Problem: SQL syntax errors with author names like "Jonah's"
- Solution: PostgreSQL dollar quoting `$delimiter$text$delimiter$`
- Applied to: summary, key points, full analysis, chapter summaries

### **CORS Issues:**
- Solution: Database polling for completion status
- Frontend handles CORS gracefully, checks database instead of relying on webhook response

### **Chapter 0 Issue:**
- Problem: All issues assigned to prologue
- Solution: Fixed Prepare Chapter Data to use `find()` by `chapter_number` instead of array index

### **Unsaved Changes:**
- Solution: Track Set of unsaved chapter IDs, persist across navigation, browser warning on exit

## üí° Key Technical Decisions

1. **Parallel Workflow Execution**
   - Three independent workflows triggered simultaneously
   - Studio unblocks as soon as editing data is ready
   - PDF report completes in background
   - Better UX and easier debugging

2. **On-Demand Chapter Analysis**
   - Users trigger analysis per chapter, not all at once
   - Faster UX (30 sec vs 20+ minutes)
   - Lower API costs
   - Progressive workflow feels more collaborative

3. **Database Polling vs Webhook Response**
   - Frontend polls database for completion
   - Handles CORS issues gracefully
   - More reliable than webhook responses
   - Better user feedback

4. **Two Analysis Types**
   - Strategic: Full manuscript analysis ‚Üí PDF report
   - Tactical: Chapter-by-chapter ‚Üí 1-2 initial thoughts
   - No redundancy, clear separation of concerns

5. **Context-First Chapter Analysis**
   - Every chapter analysis includes manuscript summary, key points, and previous chapter
   - Enables coherent, story-aware suggestions
   - Feels like working with an editor who's read the whole book

6. **Issue Status Workflow**
   - Flagged ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved/Dismissed
   - Simple but effective
   - Tracks author progress
   - Enables analytics (future feature)

7. **Alex Personality**
   - Warm, encouraging, specific
   - Conversational rather than prescriptive
   - Invites discussion rather than dictating fixes
   - Professional but friendly tone

## üìù Development Notes

### Custom Deployment:
```bash
./push.sh "commit message"
```

### Debugging Workflow Issues:
1. Check n8n execution logs for node-by-node output
2. Verify database updates via Supabase SQL editor
3. Use console.log statements in Code nodes
4. Test webhooks individually with Postman/Insomnia

### Common Pitfalls:
- Always use `$('NodeName').first().json` to reference other nodes
- Use dollar quoting for text with special characters
- Remember n8n doesn't show in-progress execution
- CORS errors don't mean workflow failed - check database
- Chapter numbers start at 1, not 0 (except in arrays)

- Phase 1 fully operational
- Author studio provides real-time collaboration
- Analysis workflows optimized for speed and reliability
- Clean separation of concerns across workflows
- Maintainable, debuggable codebase
- Professional UX with proper loading states and error handling
