## 🆘 Recent Solutions & Fixes

### **CORS Issues:**
- Solution: Database polling for completion status
- Frontend handles CORS gracefully, checks database instead of relying on webhook response

### **Chapter 0 Issue:**
- Problem: All issues assigned to prologue
- Solution: Fixed Prepare Chapter Data to use `find()` by `chapter_number` instead of array index

### **Unsaved Changes:**
- Solution: Track Set of unsaved chapter IDs, persist across navigation, browser warning on exit

### **Issues Panel:**
- Solution: Sliding panel with filtering, expand/collapse cards, action buttons

### **Analysis Workflow:**
- Solution: Removed redundant loops, separated full analysis (strategic) from chapter analysis (tactical)

**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete & Live - Author Studio fully functional  
**Current Focus:** Testing and refinement before Phase 2 development

## 📊 Metrics & Performance

- **Full Analysis:** ~3 minutes for entire manuscript
- **Chapter Analysis:** ~30 seconds per chapter
- **Chat Response:** Real-time (~2-3 seconds)
- **PDF Generation:** Included in analysis time
- **Email Delivery:** Immediate after PDF generation

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

1. **On-Demand Chapter Analysis:** Users trigger analysis per chapter, not all at once
   - Faster UX (30 sec vs 20+ minutes)
   - Lower API costs
   - Progressive workflow feels more collaborative

2. **Database Polling vs Webhook Response:** Frontend polls database for completion
   - Handles CORS issues gracefully
   - More reliable than webhook responses
   - Better user feedback

3. **Two Analysis Types:** Strategic (full manuscript) vs Tactical (chapter-by-chapter)
   - Full analysis = PDF report for big picture
   - Chapter analysis = actionable issues for editing
   - No redundancy, clear separation of concerns

4. **Issue Status Workflow:** Flagged → In Progress → Resolved/Dismissed
   - Simple but effective
   - Tracks author progress
   - Enables analytics (future feature)

5. **Alex Personality:** Warm, encouraging, specific
   - Enthusiastic opening in reports
   - Contextual chat responses
   - Professional but friendly tone
